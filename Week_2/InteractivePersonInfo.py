# Create an interactive Python program that collects a userâ€™s name, age, and address, 
# stores them in a list called personal_details, and prints each detail with labels.
# Then, ask the user to enter how many years to add to their current age, update the age in the list, 
# and display the updated information in a formatted sentence.
